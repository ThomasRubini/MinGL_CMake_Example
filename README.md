Simple MinGL example using CMake (will work with CLion)

LibMinGL.so is included here but may not work. In this case, you will need to compile it yourself from the library source : https://github.com/ThomasRubini/MinGL2_IUT_AIX (fork)

Disclaimer : I did not in any way create the MinGL library. I only made some repositories to make it easier to use
